                <h3>About me...</h3>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my little corner of the web. Please let me tell you about my journey. Everything began in the '90s with a Nintendo Famicom, where I first experienced the thrill of controlling a virtual world. Later, a glitch in Warcraft II led me to discover C++, sparking a lifelong fascination with instructing hardware to act as I command—something that simply doesn’t happen in real life (as Linus Torvalds would say).</p>
                <p>By 14, I was exploring GNU/Linux and soon chose mechanical engineering, drawn to the elegance of mathematics and motion. Seven years in CAE simulation deepened my love for coding as I used C++ to automate complex tasks. A startup venture later revealed the real-world value of my skills, leading me to the render engineering.</p>
                <p>Now, I’m blending art with optimization to push the limits of GPUs, CPUs, and memory. Building efficient and immersive worlds. And when I’m not lost in code, you might just find me riding through Hyrule on horseback.</p>
